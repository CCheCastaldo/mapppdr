### MAPPPD in R

<a href="http://www.penguinmap.com"><img align="right" src="mapppd_logo.svg" width="250" style="border:solid #FFFFFF 2px;"/></a>

The Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD) is a web-based, open access, decision-support tool designed to assist scientists, non-governmental organizations and policy-makers working to meet the management objectives as set forth by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and other components of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). The MAPPPD database, described in Humphries et al. (2017), includes all publicly available published and unpublished count data on emperor, gentoo, Adélie and chinstrap penguins in Antarctica. A front end web interface located at [www.penguinmap.com](http://www.penguinmap.com) provides free and ready access to count data alongside population models that infer abundance in missing data and allow for straightforward aggregation across multiple populations (see Che-Castaldo et al. 2017). The `mapppdr` package makes the MAPPPD database tables available as data frames (one with simple features), the MAPPPD BibTeX citation data, and the function `penmap` for visualizing breeding colony locations using `leaflet`. The `mapppdr` package will always be updated before changes are reflected on the web interface at [www.penguinmap.com](http://www.penguinmap.com) and should be considered the most up-to-date database available on the distribution and abundance of Antarctic penguins.

### R packages

`mapppdr` has been designed as a lightweight interface using well tested and easily available packages for databases and mapping. The first three (`tidyverse`, `RefManageR`, and `sf`) are for manipulating the MAPPPD database, while `htmlwidgets` is useful for exporting penguin map leaflets (described below).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RefManageR)
library(sf)
library(htmlwidgets)
```

### Penguin Count Data

All counts and presence/absence data can be found in the `penguin_obs` data frame. The `site_id` field references site information from the `sites` or `sites_sf` data frames (the latter being just a simple features version of the former). The `species_id` field references species information from the `species` data frame. The `citekey` field references bibliographic data that can be found in the `citations` data frame and several different additional bibliographic data frames (depending on the type of citation). The `citekey` also references the cite key in the `mapppd_bib` BibEntry object.

```{r }
data(penguin_obs)
head(penguin_obs)
```

It is easy to subset the data using tidyverse functions. For example, the following code returns all the chinstrap nest counts in CCAMLR Sub area 48.2 from 1990 - 2000:

```{r }
chinstrap_counts <- penguin_obs %>%
  dplyr::filter(type == "nests" & year %in% c(2000:2010) & species_id == "CHPE") %>%
  left_join(sites, by = "site_id") %>%
  dplyr::filter(ccamlr_id == "48.2")
head(chinstrap_counts)
```

You can also use spatial information to subset count data using the `sf` [package tools](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf). For example, the following code selects counts from the 22 sites whose great circle distances are within 10 km of ACUN (including ACUN itself):

```{r }
ACUN_area_counts <- sites_sf %>%
  mutate(ACUN_distance = as.numeric(sf::st_distance(sites_sf, sites_sf %>% 
    dplyr::filter(site_id == "ACUN")))) %>%
  dplyr::filter(ACUN_distance <= 10000) %>%
  dplyr::select(site_id) %>%
  inner_join(penguin_obs, by = "site_id")
st_geometry(ACUN_area_counts) <- NULL
glimpse(ACUN_area_counts)
```

<br>

### Bibliographic Data

A core MAPPPD project goal is to reliably report the observation metadata, and in this regard we work very hard to make sure all data in MAPPPD is properly cited and original data sources made easily available to end-users. One challenge with the MAPPPD bibliography is that fact that many of citations contain special characters (accents, umlauts, etc.). <u>People who contribute data to MAPPPD deserve to have their names spelled correctly.</u> To accomplish this we allow the bibliographic data to retain accents through UTF-8 special. Bibliographic data in `mapppdr` is stored in a set of data frames that allow for easy subsetting of the actual observation data using the `citekey` field. For instance. the following code returns all journal articles containing penguin counts where Néstor R. Coria is an author, before subsetting `penguin_obs` for the counts themselves.

```{r }
coria_citations <- persons %>%
  dplyr::filter(family == "Coria" & given == "Néstor R.") %>%
  inner_join(citation_persons, by = "person_id") %>%
  dplyr::select(citekey) %>%
  inner_join(articles, by = "citekey") %>%
  dplyr::select(citekey, journal, doi, title)
glimpse(coria_citations)

coria_counts <- penguin_obs %>%
  inner_join(coria_citations %>% dplyr::select(citekey), by = "citekey") 
head(coria_counts)
```

We could also easily print the full bibliographic information for these particular counts, as well as export them as a `.bibTeX` file. This file could be used in LaTeX, Overleaf, or imported into other reference management software, such as Zotero. 

```{r chunk1, results = 'hide'}
out <- mapppd_bib[mapppd_bib$key %in% coria_citations$citekey]
RefManageR::WriteBib(out, file = "~/Desktop/Coria_citations.bib")
print(out, .opts = list(bib.style = "authoryear", style = "markdown"))
```

```{r ref.label = 'chunk1', results = 'asis', echo = F}

```

### Penguin Map Leaflet

The function `penmap` allows for quick visualizations of the emperor, gentoo, Adélie and chinstrap penguins breeding sites in Antarctica using leaflet. The function takes a single argument, `species_map`, which is just the list of species (using their species_id codes) whose sites you wish to display on the map. These species are listed as a character vector, whose default is all four species. Zoomed out, colony clusters are identified. Zooming in (either by direct zooming or by clicking on colony clusters) reveals individual sites as blue circles. Clicking on circles will reveal the site code, name, and the species breeding at that site. Clicking the globe button in the top left (directly below the zoom buttons) will reset the zoom to the pan-Antarctic scale and recenter the map. Sometimes, sites are so close to another that resolving a cluster will set the zoom to maximum, potentially obscuring other colonies nearby. To prevent this, you can lock and unlock the clusters by clicking on the button below the globe button. Locking clusters will cause sites to fan out in a circle around the cluster but at the current zoom level when clicked. You can disable this behavior by clicking on this button again. The map provides several helpful layers. These include the CCAMLR Statistical Areas and Divisions and Marine Protected Areas, the Antarctic Coastline (all exported from the `CCAMLRGIS` R package) and the Landsat Image Mosaic Of Antarctica (LIMA) (Bindschadler et al. 2008) WMS tiles hosted by the [Polar Geospatial Center](https://www.pgc.umn.edu).

The following code will create an Adélie-only leaflet map, which you can then open in a browser by clicking on the Show in New Window Viewer button (located to the right of the broomstick icon).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penmap("ADPE")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("leaflet.png")
```

<br>

You can also export and share leaflet maps quite easily. For instance, the following code will save the Adélie-only leaflet map to your Desktop. You can then share this `html` file, which can be opened directly in a web browser.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(penmap("ADPE"), file = "~/Desktop/ADPE_map.html")
```
