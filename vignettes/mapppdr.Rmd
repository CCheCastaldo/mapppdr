### Antarctic Penguin Biogeography Project in R

<a href="http://www.penguinmap.com"><img align="right" src="mapppd_logo.svg" width="220" style="border:solid #FFFFFF 2px;"/></a>

The Antarctic Penguin Biogeography Project (APBP) is an effort to collate all known information about the distribution and abundance of Antarctic penguins through time and to make such data available to the scientific and management community. The core data product involves a series of structured tables with information on known breeding sites and surveys conducted at those sites from the earliest days of Antarctic exploration through to the present. This database, which is continuously updated as new information becomes available, provides a unified and comprehensive repository of information on Antarctic penguin biogeography that contributes to a growing suite of applications of value to the Antarctic community (Che-Castaldo et al., 2023a).  One such application is the Mapping Application for Antarctic Penguins and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD; www.penguinmap.com), a browser-based search and visualization tool designed specifically for the management community and other non-specialists (Humphries et al., 2017), and as a Darwin Core archive distributed through the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) clearing houses (Che-Castaldo et al., 2023b). The `mapppdr` R package makes this database more easily available to the scientific community by providing its tables as data frames (one with simple features), along with the BibTeX citation data as a bibentry object and the function `penmap` function for visualizing penguin breeding colony locations using `leaflet`. The Antarctic Penguin Biogeography Project has been funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Pew Fellowship for Marine Conservation, and the Institute for Advanced Computational Science at Stony Brook University.

### R packages

`mapppdr` has been designed as a lightweight interface using well tested and easily available packages for databases and mapping. The first three (`tidyverse`, `RefManageR`, and `sf`) are for manipulating the APBP database, while `htmlwidgets` is useful for exporting penguin map leaflets (described below).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RefManageR)
library(sf)
library(htmlwidgets)
```

### Penguin Count Data

All counts and presence/absence data can be found in the `penguin_obs` data frame. The `site_id` field references site information from the `sites` or `sites_sf` data frames (the latter being just a simple features version of the former). The `species_id` field references species information from the `species` data frame. The `citekey` field references bibliographic data that can be found in the `citations` data frame and several different additional bibliographic data frames (depending on the type of citation). The `citekey` also references the cite key in the `mapppd_bib` bibentry object.

```{r }
data(penguin_obs)
head(penguin_obs)
```

It is easy to subset the data using tidyverse functions. For example, the following code returns all the chinstrap nest counts in CCAMLR Sub area 48.2 from 1990 - 2000:

```{r }
chinstrap_counts <- penguin_obs %>%
  dplyr::filter(type == "nests" & year %in% c(2000:2010) & species_id == "CHPE") %>%
  left_join(sites, by = "site_id") %>%
  dplyr::filter(ccamlr_id == "48.2")
head(chinstrap_counts)
```

You can also use spatial information to subset count data using the `sf` [package tools](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf). For example, the following code selects counts from the 22 sites whose great circle distances are within 10 km of ACUN (including ACUN itself):

```{r }
ACUN_area_counts <- sites_sf %>%
  mutate(ACUN_distance = as.numeric(sf::st_distance(sites_sf, sites_sf %>% 
    dplyr::filter(site_id == "ACUN")))) %>%
  dplyr::filter(ACUN_distance <= 10000) %>%
  dplyr::select(site_id) %>%
  inner_join(penguin_obs, by = "site_id")
st_geometry(ACUN_area_counts) <- NULL
glimpse(ACUN_area_counts)
```

<br>

### Bibliographic Data

A core APBP project goal is to reliably report the observation metadata, and in this regard we work very hard to make sure all data in the database is properly cited and original data sources made easily available to end-users. One challenge with the APBP database bibliography is that fact that many of citations contain special characters (accents, umlauts, etc.). To accomplish this we allow the bibliographic data to retain accents through UTF-8 special. Bibliographic data in `mapppdr` is stored in a set of data frames that allow for easy subsetting of the actual observation data using the `citekey` field. For instance. the following code returns all journal articles containing penguin counts where Néstor R. Coria is an author, before subsetting `penguin_obs` for the counts themselves.

```{r }
coria_citations <- persons %>%
  dplyr::filter(family == "Coria" & given == "Néstor R.") %>%
  inner_join(citation_persons, by = "person_id") %>%
  dplyr::select(citekey) %>%
  inner_join(articles, by = "citekey") %>%
  dplyr::select(citekey, journal, doi, title)
glimpse(coria_citations)

coria_counts <- penguin_obs %>%
  inner_join(coria_citations %>% dplyr::select(citekey), by = "citekey") 
head(coria_counts)
```

We could also easily print the full bibliographic information for these particular counts, as well as export them as a `.bibTeX` file. This file could be used in LaTeX, Overleaf, or imported into other reference management software, such as Zotero. 

```{r chunk1, results = 'hide'}
out <- mapppd_bib[mapppd_bib$key %in% coria_citations$citekey]
RefManageR::WriteBib(out, file = "Coria_citations.bib")
print(out, .opts = list(bib.style = "authoryear", style = "markdown"))
```

```{r ref.label = 'chunk1', results = 'asis', echo = F}
unlink("vignettes/Coria_citations.bib")
```

### Penguin Map Leaflet

The function `penmap` allows for quick visualizations of penguin breeding sites in Antarctica using leaflet. The function takes a single argument, `species_map`, which is just the list of species (using their species_id codes) whose sites you wish to display on the map. These species are listed as a character vector, whose default is all four species. Zoomed out, colony clusters are identified. Zooming in (either by direct zooming or by clicking on colony clusters) reveals individual sites as blue circles. Clicking on circles will reveal the site code, name, and the species breeding at that site. Clicking the globe button in the top left (directly below the zoom buttons) will reset the zoom to the pan-Antarctic scale and recenter the map. Sometimes, sites are so close to another that resolving a cluster will set the zoom to maximum, potentially obscuring other colonies nearby. To prevent this, you can lock and unlock the clusters by clicking on the button below the globe button. Locking clusters will cause sites to fan out in a circle around the cluster but at the current zoom level when clicked. You can disable this behavior by clicking on this button again. The map provides several helpful layers. These include the CCAMLR Statistical Areas and Divisions and Marine Protected Areas, the Antarctic Coastline (all exported from the `CCAMLRGIS` R package) and the Landsat Image Mosaic Of Antarctica (LIMA) (Bindschadler et al. 2008) WMS tiles hosted by the [Polar Geospatial Center](https://www.pgc.umn.edu).

The following code will create an Adélie-only leaflet map, which you can then open in a browser by clicking on the Show in New Window Viewer button (located to the right of the broomstick icon).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penmap("ADPE")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("leaflet.png")
```

<br>

You can also export and share leaflet maps quite easily. For instance, the following code will save the Adélie-only leaflet map to your Desktop. You can then share this `html` file, which can be opened directly in a web browser.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(penmap("ADPE"), file = "~/Desktop/ADPE_map.html")
```
