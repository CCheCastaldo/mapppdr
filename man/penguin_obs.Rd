\title{Count and presence/absence observations included in the APBP database}
\format{
A data frame with 4986 rows and 14 variables:
\describe{
\item{site_id}{unique identifier for each site}
\item{species_id}{unique identifier for each species}
\item{citekey}{unique identifier for each citation}
\item{month}{month of observation, if available}
\item{day}{day of observation, if available}
\item{doy}{day of year of observation, if available}
\item{date}{date of observation, if month and day are also known}
\item{year}{year of observation}
\item{season}{season of observation}
\item{type}{type of observation, either adults, nests (breeding pairs), or chicks}
\item{presence}{equals if species type (adults, nests (breeding pairs), or chicks) observed at the site and 0 otherwise}
\item{count}{count of species type (adults, nests (breeding pairs), or chicks) observed at the site, can be NA if record is presence/absence record only}
\item{accuracy}{accuracy scores were assigned on a 5 point scale (usually by the observer) that penguin census counters traditionally use to represent
count precision (see Croxall and Kirkwood, 1979)}
\item{vantage}{vantage point of observation, can be aerial (direct count using an aerial platform), aerial photo (count of a photograph taken from an aerial platform), ground (direct count by an individual on the ground), ground photo (count of a photograph taken from a position on the ground), landsat satellite, offshore vessel, sentinel satellite, uav (count of a photograph taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle), or vhr (population estimate based on very-high, < 5 m resolution, commercial satellite imagery)}
